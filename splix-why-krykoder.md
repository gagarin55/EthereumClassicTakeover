# Why I added krykoder

I see there are a lot of questions around how that happened that I’ve added krykoder to the Github org and I feel I need to address it now.
### Why agreed to add?
I didn’t consider DFG as a malicious actor. Even opposite, I trusted them. Most would agree with me at that moment, and still most of the people are saying they are doing good for ETC.
### Why talked only to Cody?
Cody Burns was the only active owner of the org at that moment. There were literally nobody else to discuss with.
### Why not discussed publicly?
How and where exactly? Does ETC have any process for a nomination of an additional owner?
### But it’s dangerous operation!
I never thought it’s a big deal, it was well known and respected party. Also nobody has ever cared about admins on Github, we don’t have any private repos or anything. Nobody thought anything would go wrong, risk was minimal.
Maybe Kevin didn’t make any small dangerous mistakes in his life, like never crossed street on a red light, but most of the people do such things daily. Risking their life, and they don’t pay attention to that risk, until an accident happens. People do that because they have other things to care about, so did I. I have much bigger problem with ETCDEV funding so I didn’t spent much time thinking about that owner stuff. That was used against me unfortunately.
